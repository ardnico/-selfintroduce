I have a calico cat. She has a mischievous personality and is always playing around cheerfully. They are friendly and will approach you as soon as you meet new people.

I am amazed at how smart she is. She is very smart and has come to understand my words. When I tell him to sit, he immediately sits down, and when I throw a mouse toy at him, he catches it well. When I play with her, she looks at me and appeals to me that she wants to play with me, which is very cute.
